Geography problem:

1. State :
The state is the current sequence of actions that fit in the requirements of the game.
IE. ABC, ABCCFG, ABCCDE, ...

2. Initial State : 
The initial state is asked by the program to the user.
It is a sequence at the of the game, in which the solution will change depending on it.
IE. ABC, CFG, EIJ

3. Goal Test : 
A function that checks if the sequence has gone through all the actions.

4. Successor Function :
A function that tests if the addition of string str (an action) will fill the requirements and will add it if so.
The requirements are that the first letter of the str has to be the same as the last letter of the sequence 
and that it has not been applied in the sequence before.

PCP problem

1. State:
The state is the current sequence of actions separated to the top of the domino and the bottom.

2. Initial State:
The initial state is the starting domino placed.

3. Goal Test:
The goal test takes a state and determines if the top of the dominio sequence is the same as the bottom of the domino sequence.

4. Successor Function:
The successor function separates the domino to its top and bottom components, and adds
the new dominio to the sequence of dominos already made.

Output 1:
actions are:
MOM,M;O,OMOMO;
Please enter the initial top of the domino
MOM
Please enter the initial bottom of the domino
M

BFS:
top: MOMMOM , bottom: MM
top: MOMO , bottom: MOMOMO
top: MOMMOMMOM , bottom: MMM
top: MOMMOMO , bottom: MMOMOMO
top: MOMOMOM , bottom: MOMOMOM
top: MOMOO , bottom: MOMOMOOMOMO
top: MOMMOMMOMMOM , bottom: MMMM
top: MOMMOMMOMO , bottom: MMMOMOMO
top: MOMMOMOMOM , bottom: MMOMOMOM
top: MOMMOMOO , bottom: MMOMOMOOMOMO
found a solution: 
top: MOMOMOM bottom: MOMOMOM

DFS:
Goes on forever

Output2: 
Goes into an infinite loop both times on an action of AA,A only.
